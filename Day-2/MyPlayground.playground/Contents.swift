//Creating Empty collections

//1. Creating empty dictionary
//we can create an empty dictionary with strings for keys and values like this:
var teams = [String: String]()
teams["Paul"] = "Red"

//2. empty array
var results = [Int]()

//3. empty set
//Swift has special syntax only for dictionaries and arrays; other types must use angle bracket syntax like sets.
var words = Set<String>()
var numbers = Set<Int>()



//If you wanted, you could create arrays and dictionaries with similar syntax:
//So, instead of var teams = [String: String](), you would type
var teams2 = Dictionary<String,String>()

//and instead of var results = [Int](), you would type
var results2 = Array<Int>()
